# Animated_login_page_bear
This is a login page with animation of a bear. Creating this to have a base platform for other flutterapps .
Flare is the framework beind the bear. I have used their part of the code.
The animation is amazingly lively at still position. The eyes follow the email id as it is being typed.If the password is wrong,the bear is sad. And if the password is correct,bear is happy!

Any of you can clone this repo and use it as a base for your development.
